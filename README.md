# UI-UX-Experiment4

## Aim:

To Design a wireframe diagram for a generic application or website using Balsamiq

## Algorithm:

1.Welcome/Splash Screen
2.Login/Signup Screen
3.Home/Dashboard Screen
4.Product Listing & Checkout/Final Action Screens

## Output:

A comprehensive set of wireframes was created using Balsamiq, visually representing the fundamental flow of a generic application or website. The five essential screens—welcome/splash, login/signup, home/dashboard, content/product listing, and checkout/contact—were clearly mapped out, highlighting key interface elements and navigation paths. This wireframe layout enables stakeholders to visualize the user journey, supports clear communication of design ideas, and provides a foundation for further UI/UX development and usability enhancements.
